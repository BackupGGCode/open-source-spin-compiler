#summary Current State of the compiler

= Introduction =

Here's the current state of the compiler.


= Details =

The solution/project files are for VS2008, and there is a Makefile for GCC (tested on MinGW and linux so far, Thanks Steve, for the Makefile and testing on linux!)

PropellerCompiler.cpp/h contain the interface to the compiler.

PropComp.cpp is a command line wrapper for the compiler. You give it a spin file and it passes it through the compiler and produces a .binary file with the same base name as the passed in spin file. It also, optionally (-v), displays the contents of the "list" output from the compiler code.

The code now successfully compiles several of the Library Demos that come with the Prop Tool v1.3.
