#summary Current State of the compiler

= Introduction =

Here's the current state of the compiler.


= Details =

The solution/project files are for VS2008, and there is a Makefile for GCC (tested on MinGW and linux so far, Thanks Steve, for the Makefile and testing on linux!)

PropellerCompiler.cpp/h contain the interface to the compiler.

PropComp.cpp is a command line wrapper for the compiler. You give it a spin file and it passes it through the compiler and produces a .binary file with the same base name as the passed in spin file. It also displays the contents of the "list" output from the compiler code or an error message the compiler returned.

The code successfully compiles a test.spin file that references "Parallax Serial Terminal" (which currently has to be in the same directory). It contains the PASM portion of the pasm_i2c_driver, and some other random test stuff.  I have verified that the main object binary matches what proptool outputs for the same file.
