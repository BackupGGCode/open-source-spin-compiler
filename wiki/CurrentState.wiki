#summary Current State of the compiler

= Introduction =

Here's the current state of the compiler.


= Details =

The solution/project files are for VS2008. Others will be added.

The source code doesn't use any MS specific stuff, so it should compile with gcc (or other compilers). 

PropellerCompiler.cpp/h contain the interface to the compiler.

PropCompTest.cpp is the beginnings of a command line compiler wrapper for the compiler. It currently passes spin files through the compiler and displays a bunch of debug info and any error messages. This will eventually produce proper *.binary files that can be uploaded to the Propeller. It'll get renamed too.

The code successfully compiles a test.spin file that references "Parallax Serial Terminal" (which currently has to be in the same directory). It contains the PASM portion of the pasm_i2c_driver, and some other random test stuff.  I have verified that the main object binary matches what proptool outputs for the same file. However, I don't have the code ported from Delphi yet that puts it into the proper *.binary form, so I had to do this in the debugger using memory windows.
