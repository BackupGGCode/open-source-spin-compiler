#summary Current State of the compiler

= Introduction =

Here's the current state of the compiler.


= Details =

The solution/project files are for VS2008, and there is a Makefile for GCC (tested on MinGW and linux so far, Thanks Steve, for the Makefile and testing on linux!)

PropellerCompiler.cpp/h contain the interface to the compiler.

PropComp.cpp is the beginnings of a command line wrapper for the compiler. It currently passes spin files through the compiler and displays the contents of the "list" output from the compiler code or an error message the compiler returned. This will eventually produce proper .binary files that can be uploaded to the Propeller.

The code successfully compiles a test.spin file that references "Parallax Serial Terminal" (which currently has to be in the same directory). It contains the PASM portion of the pasm_i2c_driver, and some other random test stuff.  I have verified that the main object binary matches what proptool outputs for the same file. However, I don't have the code ported from Delphi yet that puts it into the proper .binary form, so I had to do this in the debugger using memory windows.
